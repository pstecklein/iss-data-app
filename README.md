This is an app that has various capabilties related to the International Space Station.

There are APIs at use in the app so it is important to replace the "YOUR_KEY" with your own API key

This app allows users to input there location (or any location for that matter) and recieve some interesting data such as:

- shortest path from user location to ISS location

- real time ISS tracking (updates every 1 second)

- displayed radius on Earth where the ISS would be visible given it was night time

- use weather data from API to adjust the radius of the viewing area (for example visibility data)

- all of this data is displayed nicely including a map with a visual


Again, remember to replace "YOUR_API" with your own api key.
